# Picture-This-Place Mobile App (Front-End)

Welcome to the front-end repo for `Picture-This-Place`, a mobile app that encourages local exploration, social engagement, and gameplay by allowing users to submit photos of places, while other users guess the location in the photo by walking to that place and submitting a guess using their own phone coordinates. Users earn points and medals for correct guesses and compete on leaderboards.

- **Change in Technology Stack:** Transitioning from a PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) to incorporate React Native for mobile development and MongoDB with Mongoose for the backend introduced us to new technologies.
- **First-Time Teamwork:** This project marked our first experience working collaboratively as a team. Although we had prior experience working together through pair programming, this project required us to operate as a cohesive unit.
- **Agile Methodology:** Embraced agile methodologies for project management, emphasizing iterative development and adaptability.
- **MVP Realism:** One of the critical lessons learned was the importance of keeping our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) realistic and achievable.

## React Native Styling

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

- **Distinct Styling Approach:** React Native introduces a unique styling approach compared to browser-based development, using inline styles directly within JavaScript objects.
- **Components as Building Blocks:** React Native relies on components as fundamental building blocks for the user interface, each encapsulating its styles.
- **Flexbox for Layouts:** Adopted the Flexbox layout model as the primary means of arranging UI components, offering responsiveness and adaptability.
- **Platform-Specific Styling:** React Native allows for platform-specific styling, enabling customization while adhering to platform design guidelines.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Explored third-party libraries tailored for React Native to simplify styling and enhance visual aesthetics.

In summary, our journey in developing this mobile application has been marked by numerous challenges and valuable insights. We successfully navigated the transition to new technologies, learned effective teamwork, embraced agile principles, and realized the significance of maintaining a pragmatic MVP. Additionally, understanding the nuances of React Native styling has equipped us with the skills needed to craft appealing and responsive mobile interfaces. This project has not only expanded our technical horizons but also reinforced the importance of effective collaboration and adaptability in software development.
